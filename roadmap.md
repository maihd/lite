# ROADMAP

1. Improving, fixing bugs, and adding features to Lite (current project)
2. If the native runtime have been stable enough, merge native source codes to [LiteFx](https://github.com/maihd/LiteFx)
3. Slowly rewrite Lua code from Lite to [MaiMacs](https://github.com/maihd/maimacs)'s Fennel code

4. Side roads (a long journey to find good way to code):
    - Learning and master Fennel
    - Learning and using Clojure/ClojureScript to help more understand Fennel (Fennel have fewer docs than Clojure)
    - Using Calva (VSCode extension) to understand more about paredit and structural editting
    - Create Fennel VSCode extension, which is a Calva fork (Fanta?)
    - So using Calva, which is VSCode, which is slow, and have some different keybinds, so I deep dive and custom VSCode, which should help me have a better ideas how a code editor should works.
